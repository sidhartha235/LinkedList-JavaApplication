-> Navigate to the Source folder.
-> Compile : javac *.java
-> Run : java Main



-> When the main file has executed a window appears asking for 'Doubly Linked List' OR 'Circular Singly Linked List' to choose for its representation using GUI.

-> Then a new window opens and at the bottom, there will be a Control Panel including ComboBoxes and Buttons for Insert and Delete operations on the Linked Lists as well as 2 text fields for giving input of 'value' and 'index', when required.

-> Select one option from the ComboBoxes and click on the respective button to perform the operation associated with it, i.e. 'Insert' or 'Delete'.

-> Also a non-editable text field is present which shows the 'Size' of the Linked List.

-> A Scroll Bar is also added which can help to view the nodes that go beyond the visibility of the screen. But it is currently not working.

-> One can go back to the initial window that appears when the respective Linked List window is closed, to choose again from 'Doubly Linked List' OR 'Circular Singly Linked List'.
